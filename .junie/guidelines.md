# Project Guidelines
    
* Run only the test you added or changed
* Keep your code simple and easy to read/maintain 
* rely on jsons from the structure folder
  * `workflow-example.json` - the expected workflow json the our system executes
  * `node-prototypes.json` - the prototypes of nodes that the workflow-example is based on
  * `actions-catalog.json` - the examples of actions that the action node type can run
